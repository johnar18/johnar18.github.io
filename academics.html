            </h3>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, for such a large student body, Carolina has a very
                low student:professor ratio. For every 1 professor, there are about 
                13 students. While there are some classes like COMP 110 with more than
                350 people in them, most of your classes will tend to have around 20 students.

            <h3>
                School Outside of School!?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Carolina offers more than 300 programs in over 70 countries. Approximately 40% of
                students go abroad at some point in their undergrad career.

            <p>
            <strong>Daniela Aliy (Junior Environmental Studies Major):</strong> "I absolutely hate
            signing up for classes. They are always full when you need them. That's 
            just the way it is. However, after the initial registration period, it is much easier to get in classes by going to academic advising or emailing professors. 
            I like that classes are much shorter than they were in 
              high school. Even though you never get the first thing you want, the variety
            of options available here is amazing."
