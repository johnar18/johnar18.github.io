                Carolina offers a unique mix of successful varsity athletics that instill school pride and recreational sports that energize student life. 
                Take a look, and youâ€™ll want to get involved!

            <h3>
                Varsity Sports Teams
            </h3>
            <p>
                At Carolina, we have 28 varsity sports teams, winning over 40 national championships combined.
               <br> There are ample opportunities to walk on to these teams. For more information on each sport, click 
                <a href="http://goheels.com/" target="_blank"> here.</a>
            </p>
            <h3> Student Tickets </h3>
            <p>
            Admission to all varsity sports games are guaranteed, except for Men's Basketball.<br /> 
            How It Works: <br>
            For Olympic sports and football, show up to the student entrance with your student ID card.<br />
            For non-conference men's basketball games against teams that aren't good (i.e. ECU), 
            show up to the student entrance with your student ID card. <br />
            For non-conference men's basketball games against teams that are good (i.e. Kentucky) and conference games, there is a ticket lottery.
            <br /> <strong> *FUN FACT*</strong> All students are guaranteed tickets to a game against Dook their senior year, if they request them.
            </p>
         
            <h3>Club Sports
            </h3>
            <p>
                Club sports at Carolina allow students to play the sport they love, but not on the same level as varsity. 
                Athletes have to try out to be on the team, and will go on to represent Carolina on a national level
                and play against other colleges and universities. 
            </p>
            <h3> Intramural Sports</h3>
            <p>
                Intramural leagues are comprised of teams only from Carolina. They serve as a great opportunity
                to play a sport with a group of friends. The sports offered range from basketball to intertube water polo. 
            </p>
            <h3>Athletics Testimonial</h3>
           <p>
               <strong>Brice Connors (Sophomore Public Relations Major):</strong> "The athletics at Carolina 
               are one of the many reasons I love going to school here. In my first year, 
               I got to rush Franklin Street to celebrate winning the National Championship.
               If it weren't for the sports teams, my college experience would be completely different."
