                It's not what's found here. It's who.
                <br /> Carolina's just for <em>you.</em>

                Pictures don’t do Carolina justice, and neither do UNC's official websites.  
                There’s a sense of being here, a feeling that’s impossible to fully describe. 
                You know it as soon as you walk onto campus, but the people in charge here won't tell you what that is. 
                They don't know what it is because they just run the place. But, we live here, we breathe here, and we strive to thrive with Carolina Blue in our veins.
                This is <em>our</em> school, and if you're reading this, <s>it's too late</s> then you should be a part of it, too. 
                <br /><br />
                Take a moment to look around and see why.
